# 📦 SimpleStorage Smart Contract

This project implements a basic smart contract written in Solidity for storing and retrieving a single integer value. It's built using the Hardhat development environment.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `contracts/SimpleStorage.sol`: Contains the smart contract logic.
- `test/`: Directory for unit tests (to be implemented).
- `hardhat.config.js`: Configuration file for Hardhat.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1. Install Dependencies

```
npm install
```
### 2. Compile the Smart Contract

```
npx hardhat compile
```

### 3. Run Tests (coming soon)

```
npx hardhat test
```
